NAME
    Video::FrameGrab - Grab a frame or metadata from a video

SYNOPSIS
        use Video::FrameGrab;

        my $grabber = Video::FrameGrab->new( video => "movie.avi" );

        my $jpg_data = $grabber->snap( "00:00:10" );
        $grabber->jpeg_save("snapshot.jpg");

        print "This movie is ", 
              $grabber->meta_data()->{length}, 
              " seconds long\n";

          # Snap 10 frames at constant intervals throughout the movie
        for my $p ( $grabber->equidistant_snap_times(10) ) {
            $grabber->snap( $p );
            $grabber->jpeg_save("frame-at-$p.jpg");
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Video::FrameGrab grabs a frame at the specified point in time from the
    specified video file and returns its JPEG data.

    It uses mplayer for the heavy lifting behind the scenes and therefore
    requires it to be installed somewhere in the PATH. If mplayer is
    somewhere else, its location can be provided to the constructor:

        my $grabber = Video::FrameGrab->new( mplayer => "/path/to/mplayer",
                                             video   => "movie.avi"
                                           );

  METHODS
    snap( $time )
        Grabs a frame from the movie at time $time. Time is given as
        HH::MM::SS, just as mplayer likes it. Returns the raw jpeg data of
        the captured frame on success and undef if an error occurs.

    jpeg_save( $jpg_file_name )
        Save a grabbed frame as a jpeg image in $file on disk.

    meta_data()
        Runs mplayer's identify() function and returns a reference to a hash
        containing something like

            demuxer          => MOV
            video_format     => AVC1
            video_bitrate    => 0
            video_width      => 320
            video_height     => 240
            video_fps        => 29.970
            video_aspect     => 0.0000
            audio_format     => MP4A
            audio_bitrate    => 0
            audio_rate       => 48000
            audio_nch        => 2
            length           => 9515.94

    equidistant_snap_times( $howmany, [$movie_length] )
        If you want to snap N frames at constant intervals throughout the
        movie, use equidistant_snap_times( $n ) to get a list of timestamps
        you can use later pass to snap(). For example, on a two hour movie,
        equidistant_snap_times( 5 ) will return

            00:20:00
            00:40:00
            01:00:00
            01:20:00
            01:40:00

        as a list of strings. The movie length is determined by a call to
        meta data, but some formats don't allow retrieving the movie length
        that way, therefore the optional parameter $movie_length lets you
        specify the length of the movie (or the length of the overall
        interval to perform the snapshots in) in seconds.

    cropdetect( $time )
        Asks mplayer to come up with a recommendation on how to crop the
        video. If this is a 16:9 movie converted to 4:3 format, the black
        bars at the bottom and the top of the screen should be cropped out
        and "cropdetect" will return a list of ($width, $height, $x, $y) to
        be passed to mplayer/mencoder in the form "-vf crop=w:h:x:y" to
        accomplish the suggested cropping.

        Note that this is just a guess and might be incorrect at times, but
        if you repeat it at several times during the movie (e.g. by using
        the equidistant_snap_times method described above), the result is
        fairly accurate. "cropdetect_average", described below, does exactly
        that.

    cropdetect_average( $number_of_probes, [$movie_length] )
        Takes $number_of_probes from the movie at equidistant intervals,
        runs "cropdetect" on them and returns a result computed by majority
        decision over all probes (ties are broken randomly). See
        "equidistant_snap_times" for the optional $movie_length parameter.

CAVEATS
        Note that the mplayer-based frame grabbing mechanism used in this
        module allows you to snap a picture about every 10 seconds into the
        movie, on shorter intervals, you'll get the same frame back.
